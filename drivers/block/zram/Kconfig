config ZRAM
	tristate "Compressed RAM block device support"
	depends on BLOCK && SYSFS && ZSMALLOC && CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_LZO
	default n
	help
	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.
	  See zram.txt for more information.

config EXTREME_LOW_RAM
	bool "Support the device with memory smaller than 512M"
	default n
	help
	  This config decide if device memory < 512M
	  For 512M device, it has many low mem shrinking mechanism
	  Normal project will disable it first
	  If you are not sure about this, do not set it to y

config ZRAM_LZ4_COMPRESS
	bool "Enable LZ4 algorithm support"
	depends on ZRAM
	select LZ4_COMPRESS
	select CRYPTO_LZ4
	select CRYPTO_LZ4HC if EXTREME_LOW_RAM
	select LZ4_DECOMPRESS
	default n
	help
	  This option enables LZ4 compression algorithm support. Compression
	  algorithm can be changed using 'comp_algorithm' device attribute.
	  See Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt for more information.

config ZRAM_WRITEBACK
       bool "Write back incompressible or idle page to backing device"
       depends on ZRAM
       default n
       help
	 With incompressible page, there is no memory saving to keep it
	 in memory. Instead, write it out to backing device.
	 For this feature, admin should set up backing device via
	 /sys/block/zramX/backing_dev.

	 With /sys/block/zramX/{idle,writeback}, application could ask
	 idle page's writeback to the backing device to save in memory.

	 See Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt for more information.

config ZRAM_MEMORY_TRACKING
	bool "Track zRam block status"
	depends on ZRAM && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  With this feature, admin can track the state of allocated blocks
	  of zRAM. Admin could see the information via
	  /sys/kernel/debug/zram/zramX/block_state.

	  See Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt for more information.
